## ‚ú® Features

- **Email Verification**
  - Verifies users through their `@utb.cz` university email.
  - Sends a 6-digit verification code via email.
  - Automatically assigns appropriate roles: `Verified`, `Impostor`, or `Applicant`.
  - Prevents reuse of the same email address.
  - Email blacklist support.

- **Reaction Role Menus**
  - Allows users to choose roles by reacting with emojis.
  - Role menus supported:
    - **Nationality** (`Czech`, `Slovak`)
    - **Type of Study** (`Full-time`, `Part-time`)
    - **Field of Study** (`ISR`, `PA`)
    - **Year** (`1st Year`, ..., `Master 2nd Year`)
    - **Veteran Status** (`Graduate`, `PhD`)
  - Logic to prevent incompatible role combinations (e.g., `Graduate` cannot have `1st Year`).

- **Applicant Role Button**
  - Users can identify themselves as future students via a button.
  - Automatically removed upon successful email verification.

- **News Scraper**
  - Periodically fetches and posts latest news from:
    - [utb.cz](https://www.utb.cz)
    - [fai.utb.cz](https://fai.utb.cz)
  - Posts news links into a designated channel without duplication.

- **Restricted Channel Handling**
  - Deletes non-file messages from a designated channel.
  - Notifies the user via DM about channel rules.

- **Persistent Data**
  - Saves verified users to a JSON file.
  - Caches sent news articles to avoid reposting.
  - Stores reaction role message-role mapping.

- **Role Reaction Sync on Startup**
  - Automatically restores reaction role states after bot restart.
  - Syncs roles with selected emojis and removes invalid or outdated ones.
